### Priorities for catalysts (22 May)

This week, we're focusing on ease-of-use tasks. Here's a list of things you can help with this week.

- Review the documentation users get when downloading/installing Auto-GPT - make suggestions on how it can be clearer.
- Scan for unclear instructions, poorly visible links, and other stuff that might get users stuck
- Scan the support channel for common questions/themes that can be answered by updating the instructions
- Note down the found issues so we can create a report of all issues
- Create a draft PR for common ease-of-use issues, and share it with the rest of us to comment.
- Prepare release notes for 0.3.2, which goes out on Thursday

### EDIT (16 May): We're upscaling our workflow: Read [here](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/4254)
