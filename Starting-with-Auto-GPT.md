This page contains information on how to install your copy of Auto-GPT.

# Step 1: 
Choose an environment you would like to use:
- Docker (This is the recommended option because of security reasons)
- Python version 3.10 or later
- VScode and devcontainer
- Other options are not recommended by us

# Step 2: 
Get yourself a proper openAI key.
Get your OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.
You will need to add a billing method before you create a key. Without a billing method Auto-GPT will not be able to run. You can find this under Billing > Payment Methods 
Next create the api key under User > api keys on the openai platform

**!!! important It's highly recommended that you keep track of your API costs on [the Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage). You can also set limits on how much you spend on [the Usage limits page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits) !!!**

# Step 3:
You are now ready to start installing Auto-GPT. Follow the instructions on the page which contains your choice of environment.
