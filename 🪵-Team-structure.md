## Development
The Auto-GPT development team uses the following roles:

* **Contributor**  
  Auto-GPT would not be where it is without all of its 295+ [Contributors]: anyone who has submitted a pull request that was merged into the codebase. We receive more contributions than we can process at the moment, but nonetheless we are very happy with the engagement and thankful for the interest and the time invested in contributing to the project.

* **Catalyst**  
  Our Catalysts are tasked with managing the stream of incoming pull requests and bug reports on GitHub and Discord, performing initial scanning and filtering and making sure pressing issues are picked up.

* **Maintainer**  
  The Maintainers are charged with the upkeep of the project: they are in charge of the overall architecture of the project, guard the project scope, and gatekeep the codebase. As a part of this role, they provide final feedback on pull requests and merge those that are up to standards and in line with the project.

## Operations
A number of Maintainers and Lead Catalysts also work on the way we organize ourselves with roles, departments, workflows and information streams.

## PR / Communications
We have some people working on public relations and transparency.

*TODO: update when this department figures its initial structure and workflows out*
