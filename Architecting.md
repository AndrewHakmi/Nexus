## 4 May 2023 ALERT: HyperDrive Engaged! ðŸš€

We are (currently) RE-ARCHITECTING the core of AutoGPT

This requires tight coordination.

## NOTE (16 May):

Yes, we are still moving master branch forwards while we perform this re-arch, which is expected to take a total of a
month. We cannot afford for the project to stall. We're encouraging devs to jump on the Discord and help us work on
cleaning up the master branch. Please put a message in #dev-autogpt (or wherever you see to be appropriate). You're
encouraged to request a `Contributor` badge that allows you to talk in the #dev-contributors-chat. If you'd like to
actively work on the project, you're invited to request a `Catalyst` badge. We're looking for catalysts!

If you're interested to track progress (or involve) check out `#re-arch` channel on our Discord.

If you're contributing to this project (e.g. have PRs stuck in the pipeline):

- We're sorry to create suffering (but think this is for the Greater Good)
- You're likely aware that the core is a mess and NEEDS re-architecting

So we hope you understand that this needs to be done. Please be patient and work with us on this

## NOTE FOR PLUGIN DEVS:

If you already have an existing plug-in thatâ€™s affected, please message @ntindle on Discord so we can get your plugin
spinning on the new architecture.

If you're working on a plugin, please bear in mind that one of our primary goals in re-architecting is to make life MUCH
easier for you. We've taken aboard feedback from plugin developers. We're on it, so please give us some time!

If you're enthusiastic to participate but it's all rather bewildering:
Please connect with other devs in the Discord channels, maybe a collaboration is the way to go.

Please be patient as we get the new core into shape and exit hyperdrive

### How to move forwards? How to involve?

#### If your PR is no longer relevant, best to close it

-or-

#### Wait for the dust to settle

- This may require further work (later) on your part to amend your PR into the new arch
- However, this will enable us to focus on the re-arch

-or-

#### Push for your PR to be merged into master before re-integration

- Once we've got a solid chassis, we'll be moving code across from the old structure to the new
- It may make sense logistically to merge your PR before this
- However, it takes attention of core-devs from the re-arch
- Please try to arrive at the same decision you would if you were co-ordinating the project
- You're invited to discuss in the Discord

-or-

#### Engage in the re-arch

- During this re-architecture phase we need senior devs.

- A lot of planning has already been done. Read through the #re-arch channel first. NOTE: click the ðŸ“Œ -- the first
  pinned message switchboards to info-resources!

- If you know what you're doing and feel the urge to accelerate our progress / improve our process:
    - _Please_ DM pi#8377 (you'll need to join the Discord first) and ask for a Contributor badge
        - say who you are (link your github etc.)
        - say what you're doing / would like to do
        - if you've got a PR in the pipeline, link it
