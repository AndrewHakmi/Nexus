 - 💻 Coding Skills: Proficiency in Python, pytest, and VCR.py (a library that records HTTP (i.e. OpenAI) calls and stores them) will be essential for creating engaging and robust challenges.

- ⚙️ DevOps Skills: Experience with CI pipelines in GitHub and possibly Google Cloud Platform will be instrumental in streamlining our operations.
