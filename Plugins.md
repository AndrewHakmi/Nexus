‚ö†Ô∏èüíÄ WARNING üíÄ‚ö†Ô∏è: Please note that when using third-party plugins to enhance AutoGPT's functionality, it is important to review the plugin's code thoroughly. This is necessary because plugins, being able to execute any Python code, can potentially be used to perform malicious activities, such as stealing your API keys

## STOP THE PRESS

In other news, we are currently undergoing re-architecting. To learn more, please visit https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/wiki/Architecting.

## Plugin Users

If you are a plugin user, please refer to the [user guide](https://docs.agpt.co/plugins/) for instructions on how to install and use plugins. 

## Plugin Developers

For plugin developers, we recommend using the [Auto-GPT Plugin Template](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template) as a starting point when creating your own plugins. Additional information on developing and sharing plugins can be found in the ["Creating a Plugin"](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins#creating-a-plugin) section of the main plugin repository.
