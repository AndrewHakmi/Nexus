## Ethos

We work to foster an environment that empowers individuals to manifest. Whatever structure we create is in service of this goal. If we are doing things a certain way.

We are innovating a modern async workflow. The [GitLab Way](https://levelup.gitlab.com/learn/course/teamops/) does a great job of formalizing this. If you're keen to operate effectively within our ecosystem, do consider taking a couple of hours to blitz this micro-course. You'll find it boils down to common sense, but common sense is a rare and precious quality!

If you see something misaligned, please act! We're constantly changing up, growing and evolving, and welcome improvements! (That goes for this wiki too!)


## Looking to involve?

We welcome involvement at all levels, from chatting on Discord, through submitting discussions/issues/PRs, through working in the team to catalyze development, all the way to maintaining and evolving the project.


## Development
The Auto-GPT development team uses the following roles:

* **[Contributor](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/graphs/contributors)**  
Auto-GPT would not be where it is without all of its 295+ contributors (anyone who has submitted a PR (pull request) that was merged into the codebase). Please note that we're still working through a backlog of PRs. If you would like us to prioritize a PR, please contact a team member on Discord.

* **[Catalyst](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Catalyzing)**  
Catalysts are those keen to involve with the project in general (beyond a specific contribution). Catalyst operations include:
  - managing the stream of incoming issues / PRs on GitHub, performing initial scanning and filtering
  - facilitating information-flow
    - communicating with PR authors and team on GitHub and Discord
    - making sure pressing issues are picked up
      - keeping an eye on bug-reports and feedback
  - keeping Discord issues clean / organized, removing duplications

* **[Maintainer](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Nexus/wiki/Maintaining)**  
Maintainers are concerned with the upkeep of the project: they are in charge of the overall architecture of the project, guard the project scope, and gate-keep the codebase. As a part of this role, they provide final feedback on pull requests and merge those that are up to standards and in line with the project.


## Operations
A number of Maintainers and Lead Catalysts also work on the way we organize ourselves with roles, departments, workflows and information streams.


## PR / Communications
We have some people working on public relations and transparency.

*TODO: update when this department figures its initial structure and workflows out*
