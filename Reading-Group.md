## :books: AutoGPT Reading Group

The Reading Group is designed to accomplish three goals.

1. Foster a community of developers and researchers who want to explore research and state of the art progress that would be relevant to AutoGPT
2. To use that research to improve benchmarks challenges,
3. And the AutoGPT Core

We meet every other day at 6 pm GMT to discuss a different paper.
To see what is being discussed check out the [Reading Group](https://discord.com/channels/1092243196446249134/1103371639036575844) Channel on Discord. We have a thread for each paper discussed.

You can also find a collection of all papers read so far in this [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/samuelbutler/Auto-GPT-Papers)

The reading group effort is currently lead by Sam Butler (`SamDCBU (UTC-5)` on discord) and Douglas Schonholtz (`Douglas GMT-5 dschonholtz` on discord)


## FAQ

- ***I'm an author can I present a paper?***  
    Yes! We would love to encourage people showing off their research in the community. Just ping Douglas or Sam in discord so we can notify the community so you have a crowd.

    Post it in our paper suggestions thread in the reading group channel in discord.

- The current reading group times don't work for me, but I really want to learn more and participate in discussions. ***How can I get involved?***  
    We are working on spinning up a [second time.](https://discord.com/channels/1092243196446249134/1103371639036575844/1105861124013957250) That is a work in progress though and we could use help in organizing those meetings.
