## :books: AutoGPT Reading Group

The Reading Group is designed to accomplish three goals.

1. Foster a community of developers and researchers who want to explore research and state of the art progress that would be relevant to AutoGPT
2. To use that research to improve benchmarks challenges,
3. And the AutoGPT Core

We on M W F at 6 pm GMT to discuss a different paper.

To see what is being discussed check out the [`reading-group`](https://discord.com/channels/1092243196446249134/1103371639036575844) Channel on Discord. We have a thread for each paper discussed.

You can also find a collection of all papers read so far in this [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/samuelbutler/Auto-GPT-Papers)

The reading group effort is currently lead by Sam Butler (`samdcbu (UTC-5) samuelbuter` on Discord) and Douglas Schonholtz (`Douglas GMT-5 dschonholtz` on Discord)
