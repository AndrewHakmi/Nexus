## ⛨ Operations of a Discord community moderator

🙏 Please do your best and use your common sense. We can ask no more. Your support is gratefully received.

A list is no substitute for common sense. But here are some suggestions:

- Just keep an eye on things

- Summon order from the chaos

- Help keep conversation on-topic (direct convos to the appropriate channels)

- Help keep the peace
    - Watch out for abuse: spam / hate / aggression and flag an admin if you spot it

- Help users with issues as you are able, drop a message in #team-chat to get contrib/catalyst/maintainer eyes on it

- Draw attention of Catalysts or Supporters to where it's needed.
  Maintainers and catalysts often do not follow the conversation in the main user channels.

It's all common sense!

Your work is valued and appreciated! 🙏 ❤️ ✨
