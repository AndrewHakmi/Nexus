We have overcome our first barrier and finished installing Auto-GPT.
Now it is time to configure the beast.

# Step 1:
In the main folder you will find a file named ".env.template", create a copy of this file and rename that to ".env"

# Step 2:
Open the file ".env" in a text editor to reveal the configuration

# Step 3:
Find the line that starts with "OPENAI_API_KEY=", copy your key (which we got earlier) behind the "=" character

# Step 4:
If you want you can scroll through the configuration to see what more can be set. Remember to delete the "#" and space at the beginning of the line if you want to use other configuration options

# Step 5:
Save and close the file

If you haven't used any other configuration options, you are now good to go. See the "How to run" page to have your first spin at it.
